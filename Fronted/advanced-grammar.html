    title: "Introduction to Advanced Grammar",
    content: `Definition of Grammar
Grammar is the set of structural rules that govern the composition of words, phrases, and sentences in a language. It provides a framework for communication by defining how words are formed, arranged, and modified to convey meaning.

2. Importance of Grammar
Clarity: Proper grammar ensures clear and precise communication.
Credibility: Correct grammar enhances professionalism in writing and speaking.
Comprehension: It helps readers and listeners understand the intended message.
Consistency: Grammar rules standardize language usage.

3. Components of Grammar
Grammar consists of several key components:

A. Phonology
The study of sounds in a language.
Includes pronunciation, stress, and intonation patterns.

B. Morphology
The study of word formation.
Examines prefixes, suffixes, roots, and how words are constructed (e.g., "unhappiness" = un- + happy + -ness).

C. Syntax
The arrangement of words to form meaningful sentences.
Governs sentence structure (e.g., subject-verb-object order in English: "She eats apples.").

D. Semantics
The study of meaning in language.
Analyzes how words and sentences convey ideas (e.g., "bank" can mean a financial institution or the side of a river).

E. Pragmatics
The study of language in context.
Examines how meaning changes based on situation, tone, and cultural factors (e.g., sarcasm, politeness).

4. Parts of Speech
Words are categorized into different parts of speech based on their function:
Nouns – Names of people, places, things (e.g., dog, city, love).
Pronouns – Replace nouns (e.g., he, she, they).
Verbs – Express actions or states (e.g., run, is, think).
Adjectives – Describe nouns (e.g., happy, tall, blue).
Adverbs – Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs (e.g., quickly, very, well).
Prepositions – Show relationships (e.g., in, on, at).
Conjunctions – Connect words or clauses (e.g., and, but, because).
Interjections – Express emotions (e.g., wow, ouch, hey).

5. Sentence Structure
A sentence typically consists of:
Subject (who or what the sentence is about).
Predicate (what the subject does or is).
Example:
"The cat (subject) sat on the mat (predicate)."

Sentences can be:
Simple (one independent clause).
Compound (two independent clauses joined by a conjunction).
Complex (one independent and one dependent clause).

6. Common Grammar Rules
Subject-Verb Agreement: The verb must agree with the subject in number (e.g., "She runs" vs. "They run").
Punctuation: Proper use of commas, periods, apostrophes, etc.
Tense Consistency: Maintain the same tense unless indicating a time shift.
Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement: Pronouns must match their nouns in gender and number.

7. Types of Grammar
Descriptive Grammar: How language is actually used by speakers.
Prescriptive Grammar: Rules dictating "correct" usage.
Comparative Grammar: Comparing grammatical structures across languages.

8. Conclusion
Grammar is essential for effective communication. Understanding its rules and components helps in constructing clear, coherent, and grammatically correct sentences. Mastery of grammar improves both written and spoken language skills.`

  "title": "The Subjunctive Mood",
  "content": "1. Definition of Mood\nIn grammar, mood refers to the form of a verb that indicates the speaker's attitude toward the action or state expressed. It shows whether the statement is a fact, command, wish, possibility, or hypothetical situation.\n\n2. Types of Moods\nThere are three main moods in English:\n\nA. Indicative Mood\n- Used to state facts, opinions, or questions.\n- Most common mood in everyday speech and writing.\n\nExamples:\n- She goes to school every day. (Fact)\n- Do you like coffee? (Question)\n- I think it will rain. (Opinion)\n\nB. Imperative Mood\n- Used to give commands, requests, or instructions.\n- Often has an implied subject (\"you\").\n\nExamples:\n- Close the door. (Command)\n- Please pass the salt. (Request)\n- Don't be late. (Instruction)\n\nC. Subjunctive Mood\n- Expresses wishes, hypothetical situations, suggestions, or demands.\n- Often used with \"if,\" \"wish,\" \"suggest,\" \"demand,\" etc.\n\nStructure:\n- Present Subjunctive: Base form of the verb (e.g., \"It is important that he be here.\")\n- Past Subjunctive: \"Were\" for all subjects (e.g., \"If I were rich...\")\n\nExamples:\n- I wish she were here. (Wish)\n- If I had more time, I would travel. (Hypothetical)\n- The teacher demanded that he submit the assignment. (Demand)\n\n3. Conditional Mood (Sometimes Included)\n- Used to express actions that depend on a condition (\"would,\" \"could,\" \"might\").\n- Often overlaps with the subjunctive mood.\n\nExamples:\n- She would call if she had time.\n- If it rains, we will stay home.\n\n4. Interrogative Mood (Debated Category)\n- Used to ask questions.\n- Some grammarians consider it part of the indicative mood.\n\nExamples:\n- Are you coming?\n- Where did she go?"
